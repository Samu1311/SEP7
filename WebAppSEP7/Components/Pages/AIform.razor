    <h3>Why Your Health Assessment Matters</h3>
    <div class="features-paragraphs">
        <p>
            Our innovative approach to insurance relies on the power of artificial intelligence. By using your answers to the health assessment, our AI model analyzes your health data to predict which insurance package will provide the most value to you. This isn't a one-size-fits-all approach—it's personalized to offer you the right coverage for your unique circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
            The questions in this form will touch on various aspects of your health and lifestyle. While some questions may seem sensitive, such as those related to pregnancy, weight, height, smoking, or alcohol consumption, they are critical for building a complete picture of your overall health. By understanding these key factors, the model can better evaluate potential risks and recommend a package that ensures your well-being and financial security.
